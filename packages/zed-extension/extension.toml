# Actually Zed extensions are usually Rust (WASM) or just configuration for an LSP.
# If it's just configuration, we define how to start the LSP.

# Zed extensions documentation says:
# "You can add a language server to Zed by creating an extension."
# The extension.toml defines the extension.
# We likely need a small Rust shim to start the language server?
# Or can we just point to a command?

# "For many languages, you can just configure the LSP in your settings.json."
# But to make it an extension...
# "Extensions are compiled to WebAssembly."
# So I need a Rust project in `packages/zed-extension`.

# I will create a basic Rust structure for Zed extension.
